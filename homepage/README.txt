I had to link my stylesheet to each of the gutenberg html pages by adding this
line inside the head tag:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/theme.css">

1) The font-family has been changed to sans-serif.
2) The background color has been changed to be more aesthetically pleasing.
3) The header sizes have been increased and there is a text shadow on the headers.
4) The images now have a box-shadow to give them more highlight.
5) The image captions are now in italic.
